# Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it.
Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to
as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.
The idea behind the technique is that the timer instills a sense of urgency. Rather than feeling like you have endless time in the
workday to get things done and then ultimately squandering those precious work hours on distractions, you know you only have 25 minutes
to make as much progress on a task as possible.Additionally, the forced breaks help to cure that frazzled, burnt-out feeling most of us
experience toward the end of the day. It’s impossible to spend hours in front of your computer without even realizing it, as that ticking
timer reminds you to get up and take a breather[1].
